      <p>
        I've spent thirty years in the business of ideas — starting in media during the first digital wave, moving through senior strategy roles at Omnicom, WPP, and independents, and eventually building my own agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2011 I co-founded AnalogFolk Australia, growing it from zero to multiple Agency of the Year wins, a Gold APAC Effie, and clients including Tourism Australia, Canon, Hyundai, Afterpay, and Pernod Ricard. We were known for culture-first thinking and work that bridged brand and experience before that became a category.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2024 AnalogFolk was acquired by Bastion, where I now lead DBX — a specialist unit focused on digital-first brands and rapid experimentation.

        I'm most interested in what AI actually changes — not the breathless predictions, but the structural shift. How creative work gets done differently. How decisions get made with new tools. How organisations grow and adapt. I'm building tools, writing occasionally, and leaning into the uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The through-line has been brand and growth — how organisations build relevance, adapt to technology shifts, and connect with culture. Strategy that accounts for how things actually work. Technology that serves humans, not the other way around.
